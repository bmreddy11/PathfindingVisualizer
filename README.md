<h1>Pathfinding Visualizer</h1>

A pathfinding algorithm is an algorithm that helps yoou find the shortest path bettween two points. This is a react.js appliction that visualizes the

<b>Pathfinding Algorithms</b>

This application supports the following algorithms:

<b>Dijkstra's Algorithm</b> (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

<b>A* </b> (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

<b>Greedy best first search</b> (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

<b>Breath first search</b>(unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

<b>Recursive division maze</b> 

<b>Recursive backtracker </b>

<b>Randomized Prim' Algorithm</b>

<b>Spiral Maze</b>

<b>Random Mazes</b>
